        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="abouts">My name is Andrei Ian Herrera, 18 years old. I'm in my 1st year of college in computer engineering. This is my 2nd website that I made my first website that i make is in my senior high school days my course is Ict and my subject is computer programming. Why did I make this website? This is for my midterm exam in the programming logic design course in college, and I picked Pokemon as my theme website. Why Pokemon? I have loved Pokemon since I was just a child. I watched Ash in his journey to become a Pokemon master; I joked about it in my senior high school introduction. I said that I want to be a Pokemon master. I play so many Pokemon games like Fire Red, Emerald, Soulsilver, Heartgold, Black and White, Pokemon X and Y, Pokemon Sun and Moon, and Pokemon Romhack. I play it on my phone.</p>
