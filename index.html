        <h2>Pokemon History</h2>
        <p class="mains"><img src="img/logo.png" alt="pokelogo" class="logo">, short for Pocket Monsters, is a global phenomenon that began in 1996 with the release of the video games Pokémon Red and Green in Japan. These games introduced a world filled with creatures called Pokémon that could be captured, trained, and battled against other Pokémon. The series quickly expanded to include animated television shows, trading card games, and merchandise, captivating audiences of all ages worldwide. The Pokémon franchise has become one of the most successful media franchises in history, with billions of dollars in revenue and a dedicated fan base. <br>
            The creators of Pokémon are Satoshi Tajiri and Shigeki Morimoto. They were inspired by their childhood hobby of collecting insects and combined it with their love of video games to create the concept of Pokémon.
            Tajiri is credited with coming up with the original idea for Pokémon, while Morimoto was instrumental in developing the gameplay and mechanics. Together, they worked with Game Freak to bring Pokémon to life. </p>
