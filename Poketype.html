            <h2>Normal Typing</h2>
            <p><strong>Key Features of Normal-type: </strong><br>
               <strong> Strengths:</strong>
                Normal-type Pokémon and moves do not have any type that they are super effective against. Their neutral nature makes them versatile but lacking in offensive power compared to other types. <br>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                Fighting-type moves are super effective against Normal-type Pokémon, making them vulnerable to physically aggressive opponents. <br>
                <strong>Immunities:</strong>
                Ghost-type moves have no effect on Normal-type Pokémon. This can be a strategic advantage, as Normal-types cannot be damaged by Ghost-type moves unless the opponent uses a move like Foresight or Odor Sleuth, which nullifies this immunity.
                <br><strong>Defensive Resistances:</strong>
                Normal-type Pokémon do not resist any specific type of moves other than having immunity to Ghost-type moves.</p>
